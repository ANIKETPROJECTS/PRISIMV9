# 4. PRISM: Masters Module & Data Governance
## Comprehensive Data Management Manual

### 4.1 Masters: The Structural Foundation
The Masters module is the repository for all long-lived, foundational data within PRISM. This data—Clients, Staff, Projects, and Facilities—forms the lookup tables used by every other part of the system. High-quality master data is essential for accurate scheduling and financial reporting.

### 4.2 Customer Master & Relationship Hierarchy
The `customers` table is the primary billing entity. In PRISM, a customer represents an organization (e.g., a Production House or Film Studio).

#### A. Organizational Data
- **Legal Identity**: Stores legal names, GST numbers (crucial for tax compliance), and billing addresses.
- **Financial Status**: Includes flags for `isActive`. Inactivating a customer prevents new bookings but preserves their financial history.

#### B. Contact Management (Customer Contacts)
A customer organization often has multiple representatives. PRISM uses a 1:N relationship with the `customer_contacts` table.
- **Point of Contact (POC)**: Stores individual names, designations (Producer, Director, Accountant), and direct phone numbers.
- **The Primary POC**: Each client can have one "Primary" contact. The system uses this person's details as the default recipient for chalans and booking confirmations.

### 4.3 Project Master & Production Lifecycle
Projects are the billable units within PRISM. Every project is strictly linked to a Customer.

#### A. Project Categorization
Standardization of project types ensures meaningful business analytics.
- **Type Enums**: Movie, Serial, Web Series, Ad, Teaser, Trilogy.
- **Workflow Flags**:
    - `hasChalanCreated`: Indicates if any billing has been initiated.
    - `hasInvoiceCreated`: Indicates if the financial cycle is completed.

#### B. Active vs. Archive
When a project finishes, it shouldn't be deleted. Instead, it is marked as `isActive = false`. This removes it from the "New Booking" dropdowns while ensuring that old reports still show accurate data.

### 4.4 Resource Master: Rooms & Facilities
Rooms represent the physical or virtual spaces where work happens.

#### A. Room Attributes
- **Room Types**: Sound, Music, VFX, Client Office, Editing, Dubbing, Mixing. These categories are used for specialization matching.
- **Technical Capacity**: Stores how many people the room can accommodate.
- **Conflict Governance**: The `ignoreConflict` boolean allows certain spaces (like shared production offices) to be overbooked without triggering system warnings.

#### B. Operational Status
Rooms can be toggled as "Inactive" for maintenance or decommissioning without affecting historical booking logs.

### 4.5 Human Resource Master: Editors & Specialists
The `editors` table manages the studio's most valuable asset: its technical talent.

#### A. Specialist Classification
Editors are categorized by their technical domain (Video, Audio, VFX, Colorist, DI). This ensures that schedulers can easily filter for the right talent for a specific room type.

#### B. Conflict Defaulting
Similar to rooms, editors can have an `ignoreConflict` flag. This is used for senior staff or supervisors who might need to oversee multiple rooms simultaneously.

#### C. Tenure Tracking
PRISM tracks `joinDate` and `leaveDate`. This data is integrated with the reporting module to calculate tenure-based utilization and staff turnover metrics.
